  <h2> Welcome to PARJ-ONOMY </h2>
  <p> A site based on promoting women in space.</p>
  <br><p> Welcome to PARJ-onomy. This site is made for CodeFirst: Girls and based on not only increasing the number of Women in astronomy professions and ultimately in space, it’s also to give those in need of information about the Space world in general. </br></p>
  <br><p> It’s no secret that women are underrepresented in various sectors, from politics and banking to engineering and computing. But what about when it comes to space exploration? </br></P>
  <br><p> This site will give frequent updates on where Women stand in the astronomy industry and what’s new in the Space world. This educational and motivational resource enables you to view what the historic heroines have accomplished on their missions to space and what the current modern female marvels are accomplishing in their day to day job role.</br></p>
  <br><p>In 1963 Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman sent to space, just two years after her male counterpart Yuri Gagarin. At the time only 12 other people had been to space so it was seemingly a strong start for women. However, as investment in space exploration grew, so did the gender gap.</br></p>
  <br><p>Today, despite making up almost 50 percent of the world’s population, women make up less than 11 percent of history’s space explorers.</br></p>
  <br><p>After discovering the growing disparity between women and men studying and working in astronomy, PARJ-onomy has decided to partner with CodeFirst: Girls to overcome this challenge.</br></p>
  <br><h2>The world, planets and space awaits you, and we look forward to hearing from you.</br></h2>
